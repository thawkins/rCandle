# Unlock Button Feature

**Added**: January 5, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and Tested  
**Location**: Jog Controls Panel

---

## Feature Description

Added an "Unlock" button (üîì) to the jog controls panel that sends the GRBL `$X` command to clear alarm states and unlock the machine.

### Why This Feature?

GRBL controllers typically boot in an alarm/locked state and require the `$X` command to unlock before accepting any motion commands. This is a safety feature that:

- Prevents unexpected movement on startup
- Requires explicit user action to enable machine control
- Must be cleared before homing or jogging

Previously, users had to manually type `$X` in the console. This button provides quick, one-click access to unlock the machine.

## User Interface

### Button Location

The unlock button is located in the **Jog Controls** panel, directly below the Home button:

```
    [‚Üë Y+]
[‚Üê X-] [‚åÇ Home] [X+ ‚Üí]
    [üîì Unlock]
    [‚Üì Y-]
```

### Button Appearance

- **Icon**: üîì (open lock emoji)
- **Label**: "Unlock"
- **Position**: Centered below the X-/Home/X+ row
- **Alignment**: Indented to match Y+ button alignment

### User Experience

1. **When to use**: Click this button when:
   - Machine shows "ALARM" state
   - Commands are not executing
   - After machine startup
   - After emergency stop or error

2. **What happens**: When clicked:
   - Sends `$X` command to GRBL
   - Status message shows "Unlocking alarm..."
   - Console displays "Sending unlock command ($X)"
   - GRBL clears alarm state
   - Machine becomes ready for commands

3. **After unlocking**:
   - Machine is ready to accept commands
   - Can proceed with homing (`$H`)
   - Can execute jog commands
   - Can run programs

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**src/ui/app.rs** - Added UI button and command method

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Unlock Button to UI (Line ~1829)

```rust
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.add_space(35.0); // Indent for alignment
    if ui.button("üîì Unlock").clicked() {
        self.send_unlock_command();
    }
});
```

Location: Between the X-/Home/X+ row and the Y- button in the jog controls section.

#### 2. Added send_unlock_command Method (Line ~480)

```rust
/// Send unlock command ($X) to clear alarm state
fn send_unlock_command(&mut self) {
    let command = GrblCommand::KillAlarmLock;
    self.send_command(command);
    self.status_message = "Unlocking alarm...".to_string();
    self.console.info("Sending unlock command ($X)".to_string());
    tracing::info!("Unlock command ($X)");
}
```

This method:
- Creates a `KillAlarmLock` command (already defined in GRBL module)
- Sends it through the command queue
- Updates status message
- Logs to console and tracing system

### Existing Infrastructure Used

The feature uses existing code:
- **GrblCommand::KillAlarmLock** - Already defined in `src/grbl/commands.rs`
- **send_command()** - Existing method for sending commands to GRBL
- **Command queue** - Existing queue management system
- **Console logging** - Existing console widget

No new dependencies or modules were needed.

## GRBL Command Details

### $X Command

**Purpose**: Kill alarm lock  
**Format**: `$X\n`  
**Function**: Clears GRBL alarm state

**When GRBL sends alarms**:
- Hard/soft limit triggered
- Abort during cycle
- Probe fail
- Lost steps detected
- Safety door opened (if configured)
- Power-on reset

**Effect of $X**:
- Clears alarm state
- Allows new commands
- Does NOT home the machine
- Does NOT clear work coordinates

**Safety Notes**:
- Always verify machine position after unlocking
- Check for mechanical issues that caused alarm
- Consider homing after unlock if position is unknown
- Be cautious with limit switch issues

## Usage Examples

### Typical Workflow

1. **Power on machine**
   - GRBL shows: `ALARM:1` or similar
   - Machine is locked

2. **Click Unlock button** (üîì)
   - Command sent: `$X`
   - Status: "Unlocking alarm..."
   - Console: "Sending unlock command ($X)"

3. **Machine unlocked**
   - GRBL responds: `ok`
   - Machine ready for commands

4. **Home machine** (‚åÇ)
   - Command sent: `$H`
   - Machine homes to reference position

5. **Ready for operation**
   - Can jog, run programs, etc.

### Recovery from Alarm

When an alarm occurs during operation:

1. **Stop machine** (if moving)
2. **Identify cause** (check console for alarm code)
3. **Fix issue** (clear limit switch, etc.)
4. **Click Unlock** (üîì)
5. **Verify position**
6. **Re-home if needed** (‚åÇ)
7. **Resume operation**

## Testing

### Test Results

### Unlocking the Machine

If your machine is in an alarm state (common on startup), use the Unlock button:

1. Locate the Unlock button (üîì) in the Jog Controls panel
2. Click the button
3. Wait for "Unlocking alarm..." status
4. Machine is now ready for commands

Note: After unlocking, you may need to home the machine before operation.
```

### Keyboard Shortcut (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding a keyboard shortcut for unlock:
- Suggested: `Ctrl+U` or `Ctrl+L`
- Implementation: Add to keyboard shortcut handler in update()

## Related Features

### Existing Machine Control Commands

The unlock feature complements:
- **Home** (‚åÇ) - `$H` - Home machine
- **Jog** - `$J=...` - Manual positioning
- **Zero** - `G10 L20 P0` - Set work coordinates
- **WCS** - `G54-G59` - Work coordinate systems

### Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Visual Alarm Indicator**: Show alarm state in UI
2. **Auto-unlock Option**: Setting to auto-send $X on connection
3. **Alarm Code Display**: Show specific alarm codes in UI
4. **Unlock History**: Log when and why unlocks were needed
5. **Confirmation Dialog**: Optional confirmation before unlock

## Safety Considerations

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Position Loss**: After an alarm, machine position may be lost. Always:
- Check physical machine position
- Re-home if position is uncertain
- Verify work coordinates before resuming

‚ö†Ô∏è **Root Cause**: Unlocking doesn't fix the underlying issue:
- Investigate why alarm occurred
- Fix mechanical/electrical issues
- Adjust limit switches if needed
- Review GRBL settings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limit Switches**: If alarm was from limit switch:
- Verify switch is functioning
- Check for false triggers
- Ensure proper wiring
- Consider limit switch settings

### Best Practices

1. **Always investigate alarms** - Don't just unlock blindly
2. **Re-home after unlock** - Ensures accurate position
3. **Check work coordinates** - Verify they're still valid
4. **Test in safe area** - Before resuming cut
5. **Emergency stop ready** - Be prepared to stop if issues

## Troubleshooting

### Button Doesn't Appear

- Check UI panel visibility
- Verify jog controls panel is shown
- Update to latest version

### Command Not Working

- Verify connection to GRBL
- Check console for errors
- Ensure correct baud rate
- Try manual `$X` in console

### Unlock Doesn't Clear Alarm

- Check GRBL alarm code
- Some alarms require power cycle
- Verify GRBL firmware version
- Check for hardware issues

### Multiple Unlocks Needed

- Investigate recurring alarm cause
- Check electrical connections
- Review limit switch configuration
- Update GRBL settings
