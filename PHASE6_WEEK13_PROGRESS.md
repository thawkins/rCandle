# Phase 6 Week 13 - Program Execution Controls

## Current Status
**Week 13, Day 1**: Program Execution Controls Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI interaction issue: Controls not responding to mouse/keyboard events (recorded, to be addressed later)

## Week 13 Tasks

## Implementation Notes

### Program Execution Controls Design

The program execution panel should include:

1. **Main Control Buttons**
   - Run/Start (‚ñ∂): Begin program execution
   - Pause (‚è∏): Temporarily pause execution
   - Stop (‚èπ): Stop execution and reset
   - Reset (üîÑ): Reset program to beginning

2. **Progress Display**
   - Progress bar showing execution percentage
   - Current line number / Total lines
   - Time elapsed and time remaining
   - Lines completed counter

3. **Step Mode**
   - Single step button (‚è≠): Execute one line at a time
   - Step mode toggle checkbox

4. **Execution Speed**
   - Speed override slider (0-200%)
   - Affects feed rate during program execution

5. **Program Status**
   - Status indicator (Ready, Running, Paused, Complete, Error)
   - Error message display if execution fails

## Dependencies

The program execution controls will integrate with:
- `ProgramState` from state management
- `ConnectionManager` for sending G-code commands
- `Parser` for calculating line counts
- Console widget for logging execution progress

## Next Steps

1. Implement program execution panel UI
2. Wire up execution buttons to state management
3. Implement progress tracking
4. Add step mode functionality
5. Integrate with connection manager for actual command sending
