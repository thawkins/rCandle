# Phase 6 Week 13 - UI Implementation & Polish

## Current Status
**Week 13, Day 5**: Theming & Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI interaction issue: Controls not responding to mouse/keyboard events (recorded, to be addressed later)

## Week 13 Tasks

### Day 1: Program Execution Controls ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Program execution panel (Run, Pause, Stop, Reset)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar with time estimates
- ‚úÖ Line tracking display
- ‚úÖ Step mode controls
- ‚úÖ Execution speed control
- ‚úÖ State-aware button handling
- ‚úÖ Time tracking with pause duration handling
- ‚úÖ Integration with ProgramState and ExecutionState
- ‚úÖ Console logging for all execution events
- ‚úÖ Prepared for GRBL connection manager integration

### Day 2: Settings Dialog ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Implement settings window with egui::Window
- ‚úÖ Add tabbed interface (General, Connection, Visualization, Jog, UI)
- ‚úÖ Implement form widgets for all settings categories
  - ‚úÖ General: Units, arc precision, safe Z height, startup commands
  - ‚úÖ Connection: Port, baud rate, timeouts, auto-connect
  - ‚úÖ Visualization: Grid, tool display, MSAA, VSync, FOV, camera speed, colors
  - ‚úÖ Jog: Feed rates, step sizes, continuous mode
  - ‚úÖ UI: Dark mode, font size, panel visibility, console history
- ‚úÖ Add validation feedback through proper widget ranges
- ‚úÖ Save/load settings integration with Save, Reset, and Cancel buttons
- ‚úÖ Accessible from Tools menu

### Day 3: Program Control (continued) - SKIPPED (completed in Day 1)
- Already completed in Day 1

### Day 4: Integration & Testing - DEFERRED
- Blocked by UI interaction issue
- [ ] Test all UI interactions in immediate mode
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Fix UI bugs and layout issues
- [ ] Optimize UI performance (minimize redraws)

### Day 5: Theming & Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Configure egui theme (light/dark using egui::Visuals)
- ‚úÖ Implement theme switching from settings
- ‚úÖ Apply font size changes from settings
- ‚úÖ Immediate theme/font application on settings save
- ‚úÖ Polish layout and spacing with tooltips
- ‚úÖ Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+, for settings)
- ‚úÖ Improve responsiveness and visual feedback
- ‚è∏ Add application icon (deferred - requires image processing)
- ‚è∏ Add loading indicators (deferred - not critical)

## Implementation Notes

### Program Execution Controls Design

The program execution panel should include:

1. **Main Control Buttons**
   - Run/Start (‚ñ∂): Begin program execution
   - Pause (‚è∏): Temporarily pause execution
   - Stop (‚èπ): Stop execution and reset
   - Reset (üîÑ): Reset program to beginning

2. **Progress Display**
   - Progress bar showing execution percentage
   - Current line number / Total lines
   - Time elapsed and time remaining
   - Lines completed counter

3. **Step Mode**
   - Single step button (‚è≠): Execute one line at a time
   - Step mode toggle checkbox

4. **Execution Speed**
   - Speed override slider (0-200%)
   - Affects feed rate during program execution

5. **Program Status**
   - Status indicator (Ready, Running, Paused, Complete, Error)
   - Error message display if execution fails

## Dependencies

The program execution controls will integrate with:
- `ProgramState` from state management
- `ConnectionManager` for sending G-code commands
- `Parser` for calculating line counts
- Console widget for logging execution progress

## Next Steps

1. Implement program execution panel UI
2. Wire up execution buttons to state management
3. Implement progress tracking
4. Add step mode functionality
5. Integrate with connection manager for actual command sending
