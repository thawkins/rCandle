# rCandle TODO List

## Critical Issues

### UI Interaction Not Working
**Priority: HIGH**
**Status: BUILD FIXED - TESTING REQUIRED**

None of the UI controls (buttons, text fields, etc.) are responding to mouse or keyboard events.

**Symptoms:**
- Buttons don't respond to clicks
- Text fields don't accept input
- Menu items don't work
- All UI elements visible but non-interactive

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- Event loop configuration or platform-specific event handling
- egui event handling setup

**Fixes Applied (January 2025):**
1. ✅ Updated egui from 0.27 to 0.28
2. ✅ Updated eframe from 0.27 to 0.28
3. ✅ Updated wgpu from 0.19 to 0.20
4. ✅ Fixed `run_native` API call to return `Ok(Box<...>)`
5. ✅ Removed `.with_focused(true)` (method doesn't exist in egui 0.28)
6. ✅ Added missing `compilation_options` field to VertexState and FragmentState
7. ✅ Fixed deprecated `clamp_range` to use `range` instead
8. ✅ Removed unused `mut` qualifier
9. ✅ **Build now succeeds without errors!**
10. ✅ Created minimal test example (`examples/minimal_ui_test.rs`)
11. 🔄 Testing UI interactions (next step)

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Dev build: SUCCESSFUL (124MB binary created)
- ⏸ Release build: Pending (very long compile time)
- ⏸ Minimal example build: Pending

**Testing Plan:**
1. Run the application and test UI interactions
2. Build and run minimal test example to verify egui works independently
3. Test all UI interactions systematically
4. If still not working, investigate event loop and platform-specific issues
5. Consider trying egui 0.32.3 if issue persists

**Documentation:**
- See `UI_FIX_ATTEMPT.md` for detailed analysis and changes
- See `COMPILATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for build fix details (to be created)
