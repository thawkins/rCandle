## Issue Details

### Issue #1: [BUG] Machine State Information Not Updating UI

**Status**: ✅ **Ready to Fix**

**Current Situation:**
- GRBL status polling is already working (sending `?` every interval)
- Status parsing is complete and correct (`GrblStatus` struct)
- Background tasks are receiving and broadcasting status updates
- **Problem**: UI is not subscribed to status updates, so parsed data doesn't reach the display

**What's Missing:**
1. Status subscription in UI initialization
2. Status update handler to process incoming data
3. AppState.machine updates from status messages
4. UI panel displays showing current values

**Implementation Plan:**
- Subscribe to `ConnectionManager::subscribe_status()` in UI app
- Create handler to process `GrblStatus` messages
- Update `AppState.machine` fields with received data
- Ensure control panels display the updated information

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/ui/app.rs` - Add subscription and handler
- `src/state/machine.rs` - Add update methods if needed
- `src/ui/panels.rs` - Ensure proper display

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Issue #2: [FEATURE] Create Title Bar with Product Name and Version

**Status**: ✅ **Ready to Fix**

**Current Situation:**
- Window title is currently: `"rCandle - GRBL Controller"`
- Version constant exists: `rcandle::VERSION` = `"0.1.0-alpha"`
- Application name exists: `rcandle::APP_NAME` = `"rcandle"`

**What's Needed:**
Single line change to include version in title.

**Implementation:**
```rust
// In src/main.rs, line 25, change:
.with_title("rCandle - GRBL Controller")

// To:
.with_title(&format!("rCandle v{} - GRBL Controller", rcandle::VERSION))
```

**Result:** Window title will show: `"rCandle v0.1.0-alpha - GRBL Controller"`

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main.rs` - Update `.with_title()` call

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

### Issue #3: [FEATURE] Add Splash Screen at Startup

**Status**: ✅ **Can Implement**

**Current Situation:**
- No splash screen exists
- egui immediate mode GUI doesn't have traditional splash screen support

**Implementation Strategy:**

**Recommended Approach: Modal Overlay**
- Display a centered window overlay on main UI
- Show for 10 seconds then auto-dismiss
- Display:
  - Application name (4x normal text size)
  - Version number (standard size)
  - Repository link (as text or clickable)
  - Fixed size: 180x100 pixels

**Technical Approach:**
1. Add splash screen state to `RCandleApp`:
   ```rust
   show_splash: bool,
   splash_start_time: Option<Instant>,
   ```

2. Render splash overlay in `update()`:
   ```rust
   if self.show_splash {
       egui::Window::new("splash")
           .anchor(egui::Align2::CENTER_CENTER, [0.0, 0.0])
           .fixed_size([180.0, 100.0])
           .title_bar(false)
           .show(ctx, |ui| {
               // Render splash content
           });
       
       // Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
       if elapsed > 10 seconds {
           self.show_splash = false;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Add repository URL constant to `src/lib.rs`

**Alternative Approach:**
Create an "About" dialog that shows on first launch (simpler, easier to maintain)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/ui/app.rs` - Add splash screen logic
- `src/lib.rs` - Add repository URL constant

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

## Recommendations

### Priority Order

**1. Fix Issue #2 First (5 minutes)**
- Trivial change
- Immediate value
- Zero risk
- Good quick win

**2. Fix Issue #1 Next (2-3 hours)**
- Critical bug fix
- High user value (status display is core functionality)
- Infrastructure exists, just needs connection
- Moderate complexity but well-understood

**3. Implement Issue #3 Last (3-4 hours)**
- Nice-to-have feature
- Lower priority than bug fix
- More complex implementation
- Can be deferred if needed

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Quick Wins**
- Implement Issue #2 immediately
- Test and commit

**Phase 2: Core Functionality**
- Implement Issue #1
- Test with actual GRBL hardware if available
- Verify all status fields update correctly
- Commit

**Phase 3: Enhancement**
- Implement Issue #3 if desired
- Consider alternatives (About dialog, etc.)
- Test thoroughly
- Commit

## Testing Requirements

### Issue #1 Testing
- [ ] Connect to GRBL device or simulator
- [ ] Verify machine state updates in UI
- [ ] Verify position updates (MPos, WPos)
- [ ] Verify feed rate and spindle speed display
- [ ] Verify override percentages show correctly
- [ ] Test with different machine states (Idle, Run, Hold, Alarm)

### Issue #2 Testing
- [ ] Launch application
- [ ] Verify window title shows version
- [ ] Check on Windows, Linux, macOS

### Issue #3 Testing
- [ ] Launch application
- [ ] Verify splash appears centered
- [ ] Verify all text displays correctly
- [ ] Verify auto-dismissal after 10 seconds
- [ ] Test clicking outside splash (should dismiss or not?)
- [ ] Verify main UI works after splash dismisses

## Risk Assessment

| Issue | Risk Level | Potential Issues | Mitigation |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| #1 | Low-Medium | Threading/async issues with status updates | Proper Arc/Mutex usage, careful testing |
| #2 | Very Low | None expected | Simple string formatting |
| #3 | Low | UI timing issues, window positioning | Thorough testing across platforms |

## Next Steps

**Awaiting your approval to proceed with:**

1. **Issue #2** - Immediate implementation (5 min)
2. **Issue #1** - Implementation after approval (2-3 hours)
3. **Issue #3** - Implementation after approval (3-4 hours)

Please confirm which issues you'd like me to fix, and I'll proceed with implementation. I will not close any issues until you confirm they are resolved and tested.
