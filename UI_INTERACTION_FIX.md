# UI Interaction Issue Fix

## Problem
None of the controls in the UI were responding to mouse or keyboard events.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by one or more of the following:

1. **Central Panel Event Consumption**: The central panel was using `Sense::click_and_drag()` which could potentially consume events meant for other UI elements.

2. **Window Focus/Activation**: The window might not have been properly activated or focused on creation.

3. **egui Style Configuration**: Default interaction settings might not have been optimal for the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Central Panel Sense (src/ui/app.rs:933-940)
**Changed from:**
```rust
let (rect, _response) = ui.allocate_exact_size(
    available_size,
    egui::Sense::click_and_drag()
);
```

**Changed to:**
```rust
let (rect, response) = ui.allocate_exact_size(
    available_size,
    egui::Sense::hover()
);
```

**Rationale**: `Sense::hover()` is less aggressive about consuming events compared to `Sense::click_and_drag()`, allowing buttons and other interactive elements to receive their events properly. We're also now capturing the response (even if not currently using it) which is good practice.

### 2. Added Window Activation (src/main.rs:19-26)
**Changed from:**
```rust
let native_options = eframe::NativeOptions {
    viewport: egui::ViewportBuilder::default()
        .with_title("rCandle - GRBL Controller")
        .with_inner_size([1280.0, 800.0])
        .with_min_inner_size([800.0, 600.0]),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

**Changed to:**
```rust
let native_options = eframe::NativeOptions {
    viewport: egui::ViewportBuilder::default()
        .with_title("rCandle - GRBL Controller")
        .with_inner_size([1280.0, 800.0])
        .with_min_inner_size([800.0, 600.0])
        .with_active(true)
        .with_visible(true),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

**Rationale**: Explicitly requesting the window to be active and visible on creation ensures it has proper focus and can receive input events from the window manager.

### 3. Configured egui Interaction Style (src/ui/app.rs:52-57)
**Added:**
```rust
// Configure egui style for better interactivity
let mut style = (*cc.egui_ctx.style()).clone();
style.interaction.selectable_labels = true;
cc.egui_ctx.set_style(style);
```

**Rationale**: Ensures that egui's interaction system is properly configured with selectable labels enabled, which can improve overall UI responsiveness.

### 4. Added Debug Logging (src/ui/app.rs:610-620)
**Added logging to connection buttons:**
```rust
if ui.button("Connect").clicked() {
    tracing::info!("Connect button clicked");
    self.status_message = "Connecting...".to_string();
    self.console.info("Connect button clicked".to_string());
}
```

**Rationale**: Helps diagnose whether button clicks are being registered, making future debugging easier.

## Testing
After these changes:

1. Build the application: `cargo build`
2. Run the application: `cargo run`
3. Test interactions:
   - Click buttons in the left control panel
   - Use menu items in the top menu bar
   - Type in the console at the bottom
   - Use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+F)
   - Interact with sliders and other controls

## Expected Behavior
All UI controls should now respond to:
- Mouse clicks
- Mouse hover (for tooltips and visual feedback)
- Keyboard input (text fields, shortcuts)
- Drag operations (sliders, scrollbars)

## Additional Notes
- The central panel's 2D toolpath viewer should still be visible and render correctly
- The WGPU 3D rendering backend should not interfere with egui's event handling
- All existing functionality should remain intact

## If Issues Persist
If UI controls still don't respond after these changes, check:

1. **Window Manager Focus**: Ensure the window actually has focus (click on it)
2. **Input Method**: If using remote desktop or virtualization, ensure proper input forwarding
3. **Graphics Drivers**: Update graphics drivers, especially for Vulkan/WGPU support
4. **egui Version Compatibility**: Current version is 0.27.2 - consider updating if issues persist
5. **Platform-Specific Issues**: Check egui-winit issues on GitHub for Linux-specific problems
