# rCandle Development Progress

## Latest Update: Phase 1 Foundation - Completed

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Commit**: a757d46

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error types using `thiserror`
  - Created `utils::error` module with `Error` enum covering all major error categories
  - Defined `Result<T>` type alias for convenient error handling
  - Helper methods for creating specific error types

- **Logging System**: Set up production-ready logging infrastructure
  - Console logging with formatted output
  - File logging with daily rotation
  - Configurable log levels using environment variables
  - Integration with `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber`

- **Settings Management**: Complete configuration system
  - Comprehensive `Settings` struct with multiple subsections:
    - `GeneralSettings`: Units, arc precision, safety height
    - `ConnectionSettings`: Serial port, baud rate, timeouts
    - `VisualizationSettings`: Display options, colors, camera settings
    - `JogSettings`: Feed rates, step sizes, jog modes
    - `UiSettings`: Window dimensions, theme, panel visibility
  - TOML serialization/deserialization
  - Automatic config directory management using `directories` crate
  - Load/save functionality with defaults
  - Comprehensive color scheme configuration

- **State Management**: Thread-safe state tracking
  - `MachineState`: Complete machine status and position tracking
    - Machine status (Idle, Run, Hold, Jog, Alarm, etc.)
    - Position tracking (machine and work coordinates)
    - Coordinate system management (G54-G59)
    - Spindle and feed rate tracking
    - Override controls (feed, spindle, rapid)
  - `ProgramState`: Program execution tracking
    - Execution state management
    - Progress tracking with time estimates
    - Line tracking (current, sent, completed)
    - Program bounds calculation
  - `AppState`: Top-level application state
    - Aggregates machine and program state
    - Connection status tracking
  - `SharedState<T>`: Generic thread-safe wrapper using Arc<RwLock<T>>

#### Application Structure
- Updated `main.rs` to initialize all foundation components
- Integrated logging, settings loading, and state initialization
- Clean application startup sequence
- Proper error handling throughout

### 📊 Build Status
- ✅ All code compiles successfully
- ✅ Zero compilation errors
- ✅ Only minor warnings fixed
- ✅ Application runs and initializes correctly
- ✅ Settings file created automatically in user config directory

### 🧪 Testing
- Unit tests implemented for:
  - Settings serialization/deserialization
  - Machine state position calculations
  - Work offset management
  - Program state lifecycle
  - Progress calculation
- All tests passing

### 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 2 - G-Code Parser

The foundation is now solid and we can proceed to Phase 2. The next tasks are:

1. **Lexer/Tokenizer** (Week 3, Day 1-2)
   - Implement G-Code tokenizer using `nom`
   - Handle comments (parentheses and semicolon)
   - Parse commands (G, M, T, etc.)
   - Parse parameters (X, Y, Z, F, S, etc.)
   - Handle line numbers and checksums
   - Write comprehensive tokenizer tests

2. **Parser** (Week 3, Day 3-4)
   - Implement command parsing
   - Handle modal groups correctly
   - Implement parser state (G90/G91, units, etc.)
   - Parse parameter values
   - Error recovery and reporting
   - Write parser tests

3. **Segment Generation** (Week 3, Day 5)
   - Define segment types (Line, Arc, Rapid)
   - Implement coordinate transformation
   - Handle relative/absolute modes

### 📈 Phase 1 Completion Status

**Overall Progress**: ~85% complete

Remaining Phase 1 items:
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration (optional for now)
- [ ] Code coverage reporting setup (optional for now)
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide (can be deferred)
- [ ] Build process documentation (can be deferred)

**Decision**: Proceed to Phase 2 as all critical foundation components are complete and working.

### 🏗️ Technical Decisions Made

1. **State Management Pattern**: Chose Arc<RwLock<T>> for simplicity and performance
   - Considered: Tokio's RwLock, channels, message passing
   - Rationale: Simpler API, adequate performance, familiar pattern

2. **Configuration Format**: TOML
   - Considered: JSON, YAML
   - Rationale: More human-readable than JSON, simpler than YAML, Rust ecosystem support

3. **Logging Framework**: tracing + tracing-subscriber
   - Considered: log crate, env_logger
   - Rationale: Better structured logging, async support, extensibility

4. **Error Handling**: thiserror
   - Considered: anyhow only, custom error types
   - Rationale: Best of both worlds - type safety + ergonomics

### 🔄 Git Repository Status
- ✅ All changes committed
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub remote
- ✅ Clean working directory
- Latest commit: "Phase 1: Implement foundation components"

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- Building the foundation thoroughly pays off
- Having clear separation of concerns (utils, settings, state) makes code maintainable
- Comprehensive default settings reduce configuration burden
- Unit tests help catch issues early
